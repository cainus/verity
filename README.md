# verity

### integration testing for http requests

### features:
* content-type matching
* application/json response testing with colorized diffs
* responses are verified holistically, for better reporting
* supports cookies
* supports login strategies
* easy url manipulation

### basic usage:

```javascript
  var v = verity("http://localhost:8080/path/");
  v.jsonMode();
  v.method("POST");
  v.body({"some" : "json"});
  v.expectStatus(200);
  v.expectBody({"success" : true});
  v.test(function(err, result) {
    // err is present if any assertions failed.
    // result contains assertion errors, body, headers, status, and cookies
  });
```

or using the chained interface:

```javascript
  var v = verity("http://localhost:8080/path/")
          .jsonMode()
          .method("POST")
          .body({"some" : "json"})
          .expectStatus(200)
          .expectBody({"success" : true})
          .test(function(err, result) {
            // ...
          });
```


### api (instance methods):

#### jsonMode()
Call `jsonMode()` to allow json request and response bodies to be automatically serialized and deserialized into javascript objects.

#### body(String/Object)
Call `body()` to set the contents of the request body.  This should be a string unless `jsonMode()` has been called.

#### method(String)
Call `method()` with an HTTP method to set the HTTP request method.

#### header(name, value)
Call `header()` with a header name and value to set a single http
request header.

#### setCookieFromString(String)
Call `setCookieFromString()` to pass a cookie string to set the cookie values of the request.

#### expectStatus(Number)
Call `expectStatus()` to declare the HTTP status code that you expect the reponse to have.

#### expectHeaders(Object)
Call `expectHeaders()` expect certain headers.  Unspecified headers will be ignored.  Further calls will merge the two expectations.

#### expectCookie(Object)
Call `expectCookie()` expect certain cookies.  Unspecified cookies will be ignored.  Further calls will merge the two expectations.

####expectBody(String/Object)
Call `expectBody()` to declare what bopdy to expect in the response.  This should be a string unless `jsonMode()` has been called.

#### expectPartialBody(Object)
Call `expectPartialBody()` to expect certain response fields.  Unspecified fields will be ignored.  This method will error if JSON mode is not enabled.

#### expect(Function)
Call `expect()` to make your own assertions on the response.  You must provide a function that takes the node response object, and throws an error if any expectations are violated.  You may decorate the error with additional properties that will be logged.

#### test(cb)
Call `test()` to actually execute the specified request, and test your expectations.  `test()` takes a callback that expects `error` and `result` arguments.  The `error` parameter is truthy if the expectations were not met.  The `result` parameter will contain an object detailing the errors, along with the response.

#### authStrategy(fn)
Call authStrategy with a function that takes a credentials object and a callback.  This function should log a user into your app and return a cookie with proper session credentials.

#### login(credentials)
After authStrategy has been set, call `login` with a set of credentials to log a user in before running a test.

### api (static methods):

#### assertObjectEquals(obj1, obj2)
Asserts that two objects are deeply-equal, and to throw an assertion error if they're not, along with logging the diffs.

#### register(fn)
Register your own expect helper, which you will be able to  use in a manner similar to expectBody, expectHeaders, etc.  Should return a function that takes the response object and throws an error if any assertions are not met.  Attach your own properties to the thrown error object to add details.
